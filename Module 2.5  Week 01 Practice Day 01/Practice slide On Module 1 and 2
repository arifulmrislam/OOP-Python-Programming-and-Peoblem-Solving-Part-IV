Python Practice Day

On Module 1 and 2

Problem 1

Suppose you have a floating number N.1 then,
Floor is the greatest integer less than or equal to N. And Ceil is the smallest
number greater than or equal to N.
Example: for 3.4 Floor is 3 and Ceil if 4.

Write a python program that takes a floating number from users using input() and
outputs both Floor and Ceil of that number.

Problem 2

Write a function that takes 3 integer inputs from user and
outputs absolute values of these integers without using any
library functions.

Sample Input:
-100
234
-350
Sample Output:
100
234
350
